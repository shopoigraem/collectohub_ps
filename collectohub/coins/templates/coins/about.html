                After registering, you can send the coins you wish to trade to our mailing address. We take great care of your collection, ensuring each coin is photographed and described in detail.

            <h3>Photography and Description:</h3>
            <p>
                Once we receive your coins, we professionally photograph them and provide detailed descriptions. These images and descriptions are then uploaded to your personal cabinet, so you can easily manage your offers and view available trading options.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Trading Process:</h3>
            <p>
                You can trade coins either with me or with other members of the platform. We offer a wide variety of coins to meet the interests of every collector.
            </p>

            <h3>Receiving Your Traded Coins:</h3>
            <p>
                When you're ready to receive your traded coins, you’ll need to pay for the photography and exchange services. You can also opt to pay a single combined fee for both services. Once payment is received, we will promptly send your updated collection back to you.
            </p>
